With years of being subjected to crappy and/or “girly” television shows due to my wife holding the remote with more gusto and conviction than I do, I have learned to tolerate and flat-out enjoy some of the shows that I would otherwise never watch.   Project Runway is one show that I have really enjoyed watching over the years.  Coming from a web design/development background, I found myself easily relating to all the fashion designers battling it out on the show.  Creating something from nothing is a common “thread” between both fields and they share similar processes and pitfalls.

##Metaphorical Trips to Mood

In Project Runway you have limited time to brainstorm ideas and then you are off to the fabric store Mood, where again you have limited time to buy all the materials you need to construct your garment. The trip to Mood can really make or break a look, as the judges like to say.  If you pick out horrible fabric, the finished piece will suffer and you will be gifted with a witty remark from Michael Kors during judgment. 

When developing a design, starting off on a component based mindset and not a page-centric one, can really make or break your stylesheet. In terms of my own development process, I am slowly learning to transition out of the page mindset.I have noticed I am writing fewer styles, have cleaner and more semantic markup, and am able to clock in a faster development time.  Just like Project Runway, we are often on deadlines, so it can be tempting to write a bunch of styles in order to get the job done. Similar to the designer who “overdesigns” and doesn’t “stay true to themselves”, this process typically doesn’t work. You usually end up paying for it in the long run with maintenance and specificity pains.  Taking the time to break things down into reusable components can make your life easier and have a more “cohesive look”. So, much like the trip to Mood, the way you start a new project or a redesign can really set you up for success later on.

##Scrap the design for the cliché  “make it work moment”

During the time the contestants on the show have to construct their clothes, many designers will end up ditching their original idea to start fresh.  This seems risky, especially with the tight time constraints, but often it is the right move.  Better designs seem to flow out of you and this is the case on Project Runway as well as web design.

You can easily go down web design rabbit holes.  No matter how much tweaking and adjustments you do to a design, if you are struggling, it is time to start fresh.  I find it beneficial to start over after a little break from the screen.  You can easily spend hours spinning your tires over a non-functioning or lackluster design.  Save yourself some time and step away from the keyboard before you get too committed to a design you don’t love. 

##Don’t be too literal during unconventional challenges

On Project Runway, contestants are often asked to take inspiration from things around them to for the next challenge.  These can be paintings done by children, buildings and other architecture, or birds.  Most of the designers that don’t take the challenge literally, often have much better results.  It is not easy to look beyond what you are seeing and abstract the essence.  Often the designers on the show are on the borderline of being “too custumey” because they could not get beyond the form or features their inspiration.  They also forget that the final goal is to make something beautiful and functional.  While the contestants that did successfully capture the essence of their inspiration, had great results.  They were able to have their inspiration be obvious but still be mindful on the end goal.

Web design it can be tempting to do something crazy and over the top but often the experience of this sites makes you want to close the tab or hit the back button.  It is important to keep in mind that you build websites for other people.  If it is laborious to navigate then your site and design will not be successful.  Although you may have great inspiration, if you do not keep it in the confines of what it actually is, a website, you will irritate your users and they will bounce.   I am not saying your site shouldn’t be fun are a little out there, but make sure people can follow along in a predictable way.  Look for the essence of your inspiration and use it in your design and not have you inspiration be the actual design.  Successfully capturing the mood subtle stylistic ways is far more impactful of something blatant and in your face.

##Don’t be that person on the team challenges

Most seasons there is often a bête noire in the mix and thanks to some quality editing and ridiculous personalities, it easily highlights being a dick among your peers in a comical yet very shameful way.  These little episodes of high egos and bickering, always breaks down the team's effectiveness and leaves a sour tastes in one’s mouth.  Don’t be like Joshua because the end product will suffer.  Most of the time it is the team that does not get along ends up in the bottom.  Then they are shamed by Michael Kors in a delightfully worded one-liners such as, “She looks like a transvestite flamenco dancer at a funeral”.   The problematic person is then called out on their shit in a very public manner.  Being a difficult to work with never helps any situation. 

##The Importance of Tim Gunn

Tim Gunn is a neutral mentor to all the designers and will often cause them to rethink their look midway through the challenge.  Having a knowledgeable person look at your work with a discerning eye is immensely beneficial.  Tim Gunn is known to guide you to realizations you make on your own without being told directly what to do.  He will make the contestants think and look at their work crictally bringing on a refinement of the garment.  It is great to have someone lead you to your own little breakthroughs.  Some struggle is good for you but it is reasuring that you have someone to lead the way.
