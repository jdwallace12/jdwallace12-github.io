#{{page.subtitle}}
With years of being subjected to crappy and or “girly” television shows due to my wife holding the remote with more gusto and conviction than I do, I have learn to tolerate and flat-out enjoy some of the shows that I would otherwise never watch.   Project Runway is one show that I have really enjoyed watching over the years.  Coming from a web design / development background, I found myself easily relating to all the fashion designers battling it out on the show.  Creating something from nothing is a common “thread” between both fields.  I have noticed many similarities in the processes of design and construction that they both share.  So this 

###Metaphorical Trips to Mood

In Project Runway you have limited time to brainstorm ideas and then you are off to the fabric store Mood where again you have limited time to buy all the materials you need to construct your garment. This trip to Mood can really make or break a look, as the judges like to say.  If you pick out horrible fabric the finished piece will suffer and you will be gifted with a witty remark from Michael Coors during judgment.  

When developing a design, starting off on a component based mindset and not page centric one can really make or break your stylesheet. I am slowing learning to transition out of the page mindset and already I have noticed I am writing fewer styles, have cleaner and more semantic markup, as well as clocking in a faster development time.  We are often on deadlines so it can be tempting to write a bunch of styles to get the job done but you usually end up paying for it in the long run with maintenance and specificity pains.  Taking the time to break things down into reusable components can make your life easier and have a more “cohesive look”. So much like the trip to Mood, the way you start a new project or a redesign can really set you up for success later on. 

###Scrap the design for the cliché  “make it work moment”

During the time the contestants on the show have to construct their clothes, many designers will end up ditching their original idea to start fresh.  This seems risky, especially with the tight time constraints, but often it is the right move.  Better designs seem to flow out of you and this is the case on Project Runway as well as web design.

You can easily go down web design rabbit holes.  No matter how much tweaking and adjustments you do to a design, if you are struggling, it is time to start fresh.  I find it beneficial to start over after a little break from the screen.  You can easily spend hours spinning your tires over a non-functioning or lackluster design.  Save yourself some time and step away from the keyboard before you get too committed to a design you don’t love.  

###Don’t be too literal
